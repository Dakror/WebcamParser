WebcamParser
============

A combination of a [Webcam reader](http://webcam-capture.sarxos.pl/), [Tesseract OCR](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) (the java wrapper [Tess4J](http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/)) and [MaryTTS](http://mary.dfki.de/) Voice generation.

The result is a program where you can take pictures with your webcam and have them read out by the computer.
